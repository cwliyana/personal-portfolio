<center><h2>There are my friends Dayah and Sarah. At this event, we are amongst the people who manage the graduation event of kindergarten children. 
Our class has got managed this event successfully. This time we had a lot of fun include the graduating child as well as the parents. These kids also do dance, 
singing, and many more. This time of the event was very exciting as the children were able to perform on stage. 
Although they are still small, they are very smart and very diligent. They also practice very hard. 
Parents look very proud when they see their children go up on stage.</h2></center>
